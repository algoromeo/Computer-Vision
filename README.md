# Novaturient
Jupyter Notebook for screening problem
First off, apologies for getting back at the eleventh hour. The code is uploaded to this repository as a .ipynb file and the test image and the complelted image have also been uoploaded. 
I chose to write in Python since I am more comfortable in Python. 
Here's wishing everyone at Novaturient a great day!
