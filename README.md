# Novaturient
Jupyter Notebook for screening problem



First off, apologies for getting back at the eleventh hour. The code is uploaded to this repository as a .ipynb file and the test image and the completed image have also been uploaded. 
I chose to write in Python since I am more comfortable in Python. 

The Notebook is in the 'Internship' folder along with the neccessary files. 


Here's wishing everyone at Novaturient a great day!
