Here's a Jupyter Notebook solution for basic image processing problem that I was asked to do as an internship job:

Problem: Isolate the eyes of any given face face AND COLOUR the eyes. (NOT the eye region) 

AN IMPROVED VERSION IS COMING SOON:
  I am in process of training an iris detector using a custom designed CNN Network to detect the eyes more specifically than
  the harrcascade initially used since it was to be done as a basic image processing problem. 

Here's wishing everyone a great day!
